# Nile.com-GUI

This application creates a standalone GUI that mimics an online store. Users can enter a product ID 
from the inventory file as well as a quantity to purchase. The cart holds up to 5 items, after this
the user must either checkout or delete an item from the cart. Upon checkout an invoice is created 
and the purchase is logged in the transaction file with a unique ID and date/time.
